# TSPAlgorithms

**Overview**

This is a summer research project based on the Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem, a special case of one of the most famous problems in
computer science with applications to network design and waste minimization. I collaborated with another undergraduate and Professor Gutekunst.
We developed and implemented algorithms in Java to study how the number of possible solutions grows with the size of the input. 
We ran numerical experiments in Java to conjecture theoretical results, and proved them using techniques from combinatorics and number theory.
